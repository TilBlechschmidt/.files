# Personal config files

This repository contains personal configuration files used across my devices.

Unable to decide which tool to use for managing them after being frustrated with many, I decided to use none. Although technically speaking I am (ab)using git ðŸ˜‰

The approach is inspired by:
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
- https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html

If you are in the same pickle as me, I highly recommend giving http://dotfiles.github.io/ a look!
